### Tech Stack: .Net MAUI, SQLite DB, CommunityToolkit.Mvvm (for Model->viewmodel), OpenAI .NET SDK, API->v1/chat/completions, MVVM architecture.

#### Calls OpenAI for a location-based fact, then returns that fact to a user.

#### Setup instructions-> git clone repo, open solution in vs studio, run locally on android, Iphone, or windows machine. 

##### Future improvements -> have multiple selections as to what user can query, have an AI chat that has access to db, optional run in background function.
